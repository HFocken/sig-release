Source in Catena-X Confluence + Expert Contacts [here](https://confluence.catena-x.net/x/DOZkBQ).


 - [ ] Gaia-X compliance confirmed by Catena-X expert.
	Obtain approval from CX Gaia-X expert(s), prior to Gate review.
  Provide info as early as possible; expect optimization loops based on feedback
  => check [linked PDF](https://confluence.catena-x.net/download/attachments/90498572/SD_Data_for_Onboarding.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1690457195303&api=v2) summary for requirements

- [ ] GDPR compliance must be ensured
  (personal data; Data Protection & Privacy DPP)
  - assessment must be completed via Catena-X [GDPR questionnaire](https://confluence.catena-x.net/download/attachments/90498572/Catena-X%20GDPR%20Declaration%20and%20Requirements_V3.xlsx?version=1&modificationDate=1690457195339&api=v2)
  - either the product/service doesn`t process any relevant data,
  - or - in case the assessment reveals potential issues - a more severe "Data Privacy Impact Assessment" shall be conducted (if applicable: robust mitigation actions must be completed)
  Provide evidence for GDPR compliance prior to Gate review. Previous assessments remain valid, as long as approach to handling of personal data was not changed.

- [ ] Confirmation of _published_ CX Standards
  Product Owner confirms:
  The FOSS product under review is compliant to all relevant Catena-X Standards which are already published on the [Association website](https://catena-x.net/de/standard-library).
  > [!NOTE]  
  > Failure to do so may ultimately make the reference implementation useless, as the mandatory CX Certification cannot be accomplished 

- [ ] Verification of _foreseen_ CX Standards
  Product Owner confirms:
  The content of upcoming CX Standardization Requests (STAN) has been reviewed and feedback was provided to the responsible PCA/BDA. As per current status, the FOSS product under review will be compliant as soon as the CX Standard is published. ([Info here](https://confluence.catena-x.net/x/XtyAAQ))

  Minimum: PCA/BDA have finalized all release-relevant Standardization Requests (STAN). Those have passed the CX Association`s technical committee (TC4S) and are pre-published on the website. Opt-out period in progress.

  Best case: Association Board approval available and CX Standard is published on website.

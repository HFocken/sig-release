# SIG-Release

Welcome to SIG-Release, home of release and feature management. 

## RoadMap Process

We follow a coordinated approach to plan improvements of Eclipse Tractus-X.

While every repository in the eclipse-tractusx GitHub organization has its own issue management, the release [planning board](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-tractusx/projects/26) is used to align overarching Tractus-X releases.

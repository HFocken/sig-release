# TRG checks dashboard

The TRG checks dashboard provides a product focussed view of [Tractus-X Release Guidelines](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release) (TRGs) compliance.
Using the `.tractsux` metadata file contained in our repositories, they are grouped to products and checks on repository level
are gathered to provided an overview on product basis.

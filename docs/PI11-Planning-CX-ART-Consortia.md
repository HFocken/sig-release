### Preamble
CX ART PI Planning will still be performed within the CX Consortia community. For PI11 it is planned to maintain the feature level fully at Tractus-X.
This implies a transition from Jira (Consortia) to Github (TX). Feature level will be visible at TX. From the Feature Level also the CX Roadmap will be drived.

At CX Consortia, the features are under responsibily of PM. It is good practice to create features in tight cooperation between PO and PM. 
For the transition from CX to TX the feature level itself will persist. Features can be proposed by everyone (following the guidelines)

> Note: There will be also a TX Open Planning, working the same features


### Approach CX ART PI11 Planning (delta to former plannings)

#### General

Features will be created at [repository SIG release](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release)

Issue templates are available here [issue templates](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-project-management/issues/new/choose)

#### Preparation of new Features

Labeling:

* Label: Prep-PI11
* Label: Productteams involved (initial plan, can be adopted later if required)
* The expected target release shall be mentioned in the description (if relevant)

#### Refinement: 

* Related UserStories/Tasks will be created within product repository
* Link the releated UserStories/Tasks to the feature (Jira or Github Links)
* Set appropriate state ("init" or "backlog")

#### During Planning

* Release Planning Board will be used from Github [CX ART PI11 Planning Board](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-tractusx/projects/26/views/16)

* Finally attach all related UserStories/Taks that have been planned fot that feature and PI
* Marker label for issues that need special focus during planning("open_decision")
* Set the target Release milestone

#### Lifetime

UserStory/Task usually one iteration
Feature usually one planning increment

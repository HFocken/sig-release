### Preamble
For PI11 it is planned to maintain the feature level fully at Tractus-X.
This implies a transition into Eclipse Tractus-X GitHub organisation. Feature level will be visible at Tractus-X.

The features are under responsibility of PM/PO. For the transition into TX the feature level itself will persist. Features can be proposed by everyone (following the guidelines).

### Approach PI11 Planning (delta to former plannings)

#### General

- Features will be created at [repository SIG release](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release)
- Issue templates are available here [issue templates](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-project-management/issues/new/choose)

#### Preparation of new Features

* Label: Prep-PI11
* Label: ProductTeams involved (initial plan, can be adopted later if required)
* The expected target release shall be mentioned in the description (if relevant)

#### Refinement: 

* Related UserStories/Tasks will be created within product repository
* Link the related UserStories/Tasks to the feature (only GitHub Links)
* Set appropriate state ("init" or "backlog")

#### During Planning

* Release Planning Board will be used from GitHub [Planning Board](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-tractusx/projects/26/views/16)
* Finally, attach all related UserStories/Tasks that have been planned fot that feature and PI
* Marker label for issues that need special focus during planning("open_decision")
* Set the target Release milestone

#### Lifetime

* UserStory/Task usually one iteration
* Feature usually one planning increment
